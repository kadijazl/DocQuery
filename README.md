# 🧾 DocQuery: Receipt Q&A System
DocQuery is a document-based question answering tool tailored for receipts. Simply upload an image file (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) and ask a question. The system returns:
- A direct answer extracted from the receipt
- The original image with the answer area highlighted

## 💡 How It Works
- Utilizes LayoutLM, a layout-aware transformer model that excels at understanding structured documents like receipts.
- Initially experimented with Donut, but switched due to its limitations in handling layout-sensitive document.
